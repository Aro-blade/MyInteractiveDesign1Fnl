    <h4>Ox Stance</h4>
    <p>The first position, Ox, is essentially assumed by drawing the weapon up and to the "outside."  
      The point may aim somewhat downward or upward but typically aims at the opponent's face or throat.  
      Note the blade alignment by observing the angle of the cross: the blade is neither vertical nor horizontal but slightly diagonal, in fact, the natural position achieved by cutting upward.  
      In this position, note the short (back) edge aims not upward or downward but toward the fighter, while the thumb is under the blade, not on top of it.  
      The hilt is held just in front, beside, or above the head at temple level.  
      Also, the Ox is not a "hanging point" or hanging guard position.  
      The Ox position, although not as stable as others, protects well, allows a direct threat with its straight thrust, a turn to cut diagonally downward, or a pullback to cut from underneath.</p>

    <h4>Plow Stance</h4>
    <p>Lowering the weapon to the middle achieves the second position, or Plow.  
      Either passing or making a small step of the foot in transition is useful here.  
      The point should aim at the opponent's chest or throat, and the hilt should be held more off to the side in front of the hip joint rather than dead center between the legs.  
      Note that depending on which leg leads in the Plow stance, the hip the pommel is in front of changes.  
      Each of these left plow positions, long edge up and long edge down, appear in the source texts.  
      To achieve either, the left hand should simply keep a looser grip to allow it to turn while the right maintains normal grip pressure.  
      The long edge down position permits quick slices and upward thrusts.  
      Overall, the Plow protects and covers very well while permitting all attacks.</p>

    <h4>Tail Stance</h4>
    <p>Passing the foot again is useful in transitioning here.  
      This is called the Tail position.  
      Note on the right side here the point slants downward and behind, not off to the side, with the long edge aiming forward at the opponent, not at the ground.  
      This permits a strong rising cut with the long edge, ending in an Ox position.  
      Otherwise, if held with the short edge forward (such as in a left-side posture), a full upward cut with the back of the blade ends in the Roof position.  
      As with all the stances, except Plow, the sword is held essentially at a 45-degree angle.  
      The Tail easily lifts to the Roof or rises up into an Ox on the opposite side.</p>
